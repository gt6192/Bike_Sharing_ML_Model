## General Information
- I have a dataset which contains past two years data.
- By this project we are trying to make a prediction model which will be able to predict the next year sale.

## Conclusions
- Windspeed can affect the sales with very high rate.
- sales on weekends are more as compared to weekdays.
- If it is snowing, then the sales will be very less.
